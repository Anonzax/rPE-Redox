What is the program?
It is used to examine and manage incoming and outgoing socket traffic in systems and games.

How to use?
When we start the program, we are greeted by a screen like this

To specify which application we will use in this section, we click on "select procces" and then "open procces".

We can examine the incoming socket traffic from here. If you want to manage it, there is a send and "add to send list" section. We can see these options by right-clicking on the socket we have selected.
If we press the send button, we can send a single socket, but if we press the "add to send list" section, we can send multiple sockets. I will give an example from the add to send list section. When we press the add to send list button, a window called "send list" greets us;

From this window, we can press the "Get ID" section and then press the start button to resend the socket.
The "Continuously" socket is available to send until it stops sending.
"Time(s)" is available to set how many times we will send the socket.
"Timer" is available to set how many milliseconds apart we can send.
